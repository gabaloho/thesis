Description: Federated learning avoids centralizing data in a central server by distributing the
model training process across devices, thus protecting privacy to some extent. However, existing
research shows that model updates (e.g., gradients or weights) exchanged during federated learning
may still indirectly leak sensitive information about the original data. Currently, single-key
homomorphic encryption methods applied in federated learning cannot solve the problem of
privacy leakage that may be caused by the collusion between the participant and the federated
learning server, whereas existing privacy-preserving federated learning schemes based on multi-key
homomorphic encryption in semi-honest environments have deﬁciencies and limitations in terms of
security and application conditions. To this end, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated
learning scheme based on multi-key fully homomorphic encryption to cope with the potential risk
of privacy leakage in traditional fed ...

Description: AbstractIn recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has
evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the
huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC)
technologies have signiﬁcantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a
new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system
can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing
their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the ﬁeld of
information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining
medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises
concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning
(FL) overcomes the preceding difﬁculties by util ...

Description: Federated Learning (FL) transformed decentralized machine learning by allowing
joint model training without mutually sharing raw data, hence being especially useful in privacy-
sensitive applications like healthcare, e-commerce, and ﬁnance. Even with its privacy-focused
architecture, FL is vulnerable to a range of security attacks such as data poisoning, model inversion,
membership inference attacks, and communication interception. These attacks compromise the
conﬁdentiality of patients in healthcare, consumer data privacy in e-commerce, and ﬁnancial safety
in banking, thus necessitating effective privacy-preserving mechanisms. This survey presents a
classiﬁcation of security threats in FL, grouping them by their source, effect, and attack mode. We
review state-of-the-art countermeasures, such as differential privacy, secure multi-party
computation, homomorphic encryption, and resilient aggregation methods, their effectiveness,
trade-offs, and real-world applicability to F ...

Privacy necessitates the concealment of individual client updates, while security requires the
disclosure of client updates to detect anomalies. While most existing research focused on the
privacy and security aspects of FL, very few studies have addressed the compatibility of these two
demands. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a comprehensive defense scheme
that ensures privacy, security, and compatibility in FL. We categorize the existing literature into two
key directions: privacy defense and security defense. Privacy defense includes methods based on
additive masks, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environment,
whereas security defense encompasses distance-, performance-, clustering-, and similarity-based
anomaly detection techniques and statistical information-based anomaly update bypassing
techniques when the server is trusted and privacy-compatible anomaly update detection techniques
when the server is not trusted. In additi ...

Blockchain ledger technology provides decentralization of federated learning models without
relying on a central server. Moreover, the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and
decrypts the gradients of the model to preserve privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework:
(i) train the local model by a novel capsule network for segmentation and classiﬁcation of COVID-
19 images, (ii) furthermore, we use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model
that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, (iii) ﬁnally, the model is shared over a decentralized
platform through the proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of
blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing over the
decentralized network. To validate our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments
and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme. ...

Description: In this work, the federated learning mechanism is introduced into the deep learning of
medical models in Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare system. Cryptographic primitives,
including masks and homomorphic encryption, are applied for further protecting local models, so as
to prevent the adversary from inferring private medical data by various attacks such as model
reconstruction attack or model inversion attack, etc. The qualities of the datasets owned by different
participants are considered as the main factor for measuring the contribution rate of the local model
to the global model in each training epoch, instead of the size of datasets commonly used in deep
learning. A dropout-tolerable scheme is proposed in which the process of federated learning would
not be terminated if the number of online clients is not less than a preset threshold. Through the
analysis of the security, it shows that the proposed scheme satisﬁes data privacy. Computation cost
and communica ...

Learning. The main reason for this is to build efﬁcient artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) based models for
preliminary diagnosis of various diseases, it would require a large corpus of data which can be
obtained by pooling in patient information from multiple sources. However, for these sources to
agree to sharing their data across distributed systems for training algorithms and models, there has
to be an assurance that there will be no disclosure of the personally identiﬁable information (PII) of
the respective Data Owners. This paper proposes PriMed, an approach to build robust privacy
preserving additions to convolutional neural networks (CNN) for training and performing inference
on medical images without compromising privacy. Since privacy of the data is preserved, large
amounts of data can be effectively accumulated to increase the accuracy and efﬁciency of AI
models in the ﬁeld of healthcare. This involves implementing a hybrid of privacy-enhancing
techniques like Federated Learning,  ...

Description: The increasing integration of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems into critical societal
sectors has created an urgent demand for robust privacy-preserving methods. Traditional
approaches such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption often struggle to maintain an
effective balance between protecting sensitive information and preserving data utility for AI
applications. This challenge has become particularly acute as organizations must comply with
evolving AI governance frameworks while maintaining the effectiveness of their AI systems. This
paper aims to introduce and validate data obfuscation through latent space projection (LSP), a novel
privacy-preserving technique designed to enhance AI governance and ensure responsible AI
compliance. The primary goal is to develop a method that can effectively protect sensitive data
while maintaining essential features necessary for AI model training and inference, thereby
addressing the limitations of existing privacy-prese ...
